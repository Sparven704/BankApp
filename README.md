# BankApp

Would have liked to solve the way I create and store users in a prettier way. I experimented with using jagged arrays for it but in the end I didn't manage to solve it in an efficient way for the classes and methods I had already created.
So I instead ended up with what I have now, with creating an array with bank accounts in them and then assign them to the correct user when I create a new user.
Would have liked to be able to create the array with accounts at the same time as I create a user.
One advantage is that I can make a method to let users create new accounts a bit cleaner this way I think. Might be wrong on that one though. I have not actually implemented that feature yet.
